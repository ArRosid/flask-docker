Running Flask Project on Docker

This project will help you to know how to run Flask Project on Docker Container. To run this project, you just need to clone this repository and type <b>docker-compose up --build</b> in your terminal. Once the container up, you can open your browser and navigate to localhost:8000, you will see Hello World.

If you want to edit the flask, go to web_app/app.py and edit as you want. If you edit the flask, you don't need to re run docker container.
